Python module/library to aid with mrna stuff. Simple class to use. Depends of datetime

Creates text files to store large amounts of information, and allows you to easily copy results and store results. To do this, it uses the datetime library so we can create unique files.
Include 5 functions, each doing something different
Pretty alright comments explaining the functions. Tester is just a program I created so you can test the functionality of the library.
